	<h1>Kyle Pletcher</h1>
	<ul>
		<p>Just a person just out of college that likes video games and programming video game related things. I'm using this program with the pseudonym Rocket Punch Studios to keep track of my projects and other miscellaneous things I've worked on.</p>
		<p>I've recently made the switch from Squarespace which was a webhosting service to using GitHub pages. I mainly made the switch since Squarespace was too constricting, plus hosting a GitHub page is free! The postitive thing is getting back into web development. Instead of using a basic template I decided this would be a good opportunity to learn more HTML and javascript. The website you are on is completely made from scratch with the help of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for maintaining the blog.</p>
