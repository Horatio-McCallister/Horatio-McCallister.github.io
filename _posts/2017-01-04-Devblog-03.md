It is a new year! Once again it has been awhile since I have posted progress. It's been a busy time since the last time I posted and now. But hopefully I'll have some time to tackle more of this project. The screenshot above is of the new main menu screen that has been created. It even includes fancy animations and when the player presses any keys game options appear in the white circle. So far these include "Start Game", "Options", and "Exit Game". Start and exit game is self explanatory. Options so far doesn't include anything but this is where the player will be to control simple options such as changing name and full screen options.<!--more-->

# Straight Hallways

Another thing I was playing around with at the time I made the main menu was hallway variation. I tried to have it place a hallway in a direction a random amount of times then change direction and go that way a random number of times. However upon implementing this created very unnatural and rigid looking diagonals. Increasing the random number just made large expanses of empty hallway space. So for the time being I went back to the original hallway generation of going to room to room in a very orderly fashion.

# Some New Tools

The screenshot above shows some updated sprites. Mainly the walls, doors, anvil, and the player. This was done thanks to the program SpriteIlluminator. This was offered in the most recent Humble Bundle which focused on game making with several tools I've been testing out. Now SpriteIlluminator is a simple program that changes the lighting for sprites as well as changing things like texture and embossing. It makes sprites pop a lot more then what I am capable of creating from scratch.

# Going Forward

From here I want to get all the room types I want finished. This includes other spawn-able items such as chests, fountains, and other miscellaneous items. I want to also begin on adding enemies and different enemy types as well. It's been too long to wander alone. One newer feature I think I might add would be a key system where you can find keys from drops or whatnot and use these keys to reliably unlock chests and doors without any sort of failure. But this is what I have going on at the moment, will post soon with some more progress.
