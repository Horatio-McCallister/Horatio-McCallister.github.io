Will be strange starting a devblog in the middle of development, but got to start somewhere. I guess I'll just start off into the last changes that were made. This time I changed the Speed stat into the Luck stat. The Speed stat originally was going to be used to determine how well the player or enemy could get away from one another if they were to run away. I decided this was overall pointless since I could group this up with the Dexterity stat.

So instead I changed it to the Luck stat. This stat will govern a lot of different things that happen in the game as lots of bad things tend to happen in roguelikes. The initial uses for luck will be critical hits in combat, the different type of gear that spawns will be influenced by luck. This will also apply to things like repairing equipment or opening chests and whatnot.

As of now the Luck stat has been added however it doesn't apply to anything in the game yet. This is the next small term change that will happen next. The next large change will most likely be implementing the gemstone rings that will allow the player to cast spells depending on the different gemstones at the cost of ring durability.
