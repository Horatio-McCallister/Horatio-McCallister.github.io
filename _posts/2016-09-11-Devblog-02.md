It has been awhile, finally got the site back up and running but that doesn't mean I haven't been working on a whole bunch of features. As seen in the screenshot the most obvious change is that the game looks quite a bit different. Every tile has been changed from a solid color to a bit of texture. This will be a placeholder once again but it looks a lot more appealing then previously. Another change was the general GUI of the game, I wanted to make the text easier to see especially with the log in the top right corner. Again this is placeholder since I'm not a fan of the color and don't think it meshes well with the pallet of the game.

# Previously...

So last devblog I noted that I would be working on introducing the luck stat into various features of the game, as of now it has been implemented in the combat of the game. There are now critical hits which can occur which depend on luck. The other thing that was mentioned was implementing ring abilities. As of now the only ring ability that was implemented was healing. Using the heal spell will heal a various amount of health depending on the rarity of the ring, the rarer the more health you can heal. Each use of a ring spell will decrease the durability of the ring.

# Other Additions...

With ring durability able to decrease and break, I added the first new specialty room. The anvil room. With the anvil room the player is able to repair rings. The anvil has a random number of uses between one and five. Once attempting to repair you can repair the durability by a random amount, there is a chance the repair can fail in which nothing happens. Once the anvil is completely used up it will break and be unusable. One of these rooms will spawn on each floor.

Another addition which can be seen in the screenshots above are doors! Doors have been added to the game which typically will close off a room. The door will spawn either locked or unlocked. If unlocked the player can simply open them, else they can't. To open a locked door at the moment is to kick the door down. This has a chance of working or it has a chance of hurting the player for a little bit of damage.

Apart from doors there has been a boss level created. This is the final level of the game where the player will fight the final boss. This level is the only one that is not randomly generated. It includes an anvil room for final preparations.

After beating the final boss the game will tell the player that they have won. It will then transfer the player to the high score screen which will show the high scores right now, it needs to be worked on some more but isn't a major priority now.

# What's next.

Next up is to get the game to be more self contained, by this I mean adding a basic main menu screen in which you can start a game, view high scores, exit game etc. With this the game will be able to be played in full without the need of any external help. Another thing I want to work on next is to make more room types and variations. Eventually I want to start making some vanity items to place in rooms just so they aren't as empty.
